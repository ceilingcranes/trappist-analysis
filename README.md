# Trappist-1 b and c analysis
Given data from transit times for the exoplanets TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c, use Householder reflectors to generate a QR factorization to 
create a root mean square line to the data. Using this method, I found the period of the planets within 2 seconds of the offical predicted value.
